# GRAD Scoreboard
**WIP**

This won't:
* record any kind of points or statistics througout the game
* save statistics on the server

This will:
* take a specifically formatted array of statistics
* optionally sort it
* display it in a dialog
* adjust the dialog dimensions depending on array contents
* try to find the player's profile name and highlight their statistics
